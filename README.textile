h1. rah_nocache

p. A simple "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com plugin that tries to force no-cache headers to admin-side pages. By this we try to remove all browser caching that could destroy the admin's site management work. Usually backend editor forms and informative pages shouldn't be cached, but should contain the most up-to-date information as possible. Note that if the browser ignores headers, the plugin won't work.

p. Recommended

h2. Installation and usage
