h1. rah_nocache

p. A simple "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com plugin that tries to force no-cache headers to the backend pages. By this we try to remove all browser caching that could destroy the admin's site management work. Usually the admin doesn't want to cache the backend editor forms. Note that if the browser ignores headers, the plugin won't work.
